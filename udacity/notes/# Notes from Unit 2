# Notes from Unit 2
"<b> some bold text </b>"
a = "some bold text"
"<b> %s </b>" %a

def write_form(error=""):
	self.response.out.write(form % {"error": error})

# Escaping Bad Input
 " ->> &quot;
 > -> &gt;
 < -> &lt;
 & -> &amp;"

# Another way to do this:
# Use the built-in function!!
#
#import cgi

def escape_html(s):
	return cgi.escape(s, quote = True)

	// quote = True makes sure that the code escapes the quotes

ROT13:
Keep case, preserve punctuation and whitespace
You might need to escape html
use a textarea
submit switches between the ROT13 and unscrambled
